# ENGINE GOVERNANCE — LITHOS (GEOLOGY & MATERIALS)

Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Engine Role: TRUTH_ENGINE  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE

LITHOS is bound by CORE governance law:

- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md  
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  

---

## 2. ENGINE ROLE & SCOPE

LITHOS computes **material and subsurface domain truth**, including:

- layered material response  
- impedance and damping  
- conductivity/permittivity proxies  
- fracture/void indicators (if modeled)  

---

## 3. NON-SCOPE (PROHIBITIONS)

LITHOS MUST NOT:

- recommend extraction or drilling actions  
- infer ownership, land rights, or intent  
- access networks  
- publish independently  
- call other engines directly  

---

## 4. DETERMINISM

LITHOS outputs MUST be reproducible under identical inputs and parameters.

---

## 5. OUTPUT & SEALING

Outputs MUST be sealed, deterministic, and hash-verified.

---

## 6. SAFETY CONSTRAINTS

LITHOS MUST:

- label uncertainty and resolution limits  
- prohibit targeting or economic conclusions  

---

## 7. CHANGE CONTROL

Changes require registry update and audit trail.

---

## 8. FINAL DECLARATION

LITHOS produces **geologic/material truth only**.
