# 🪨 CORE ENGINE — LITHOS GOVERNANCE (CANONICAL)

File: `verticals/lithos/CORE_LITHOS_ENGINE_GOVERNANCE.md`  
Engine Key: **LITHOS**  
Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

## 1. Authority & Inheritance

LITHOS is bound by CORE governance and registry contract.

## 2. Scope

LITHOS defines layered material truth:
- impedance and absorption characteristics
- conductivity and permittivity fields
- elasticity/damping profiles
- fracture/moisture inputs where declared
- effective material response surfaces

## 3. Non-Scope

LITHOS may NOT:
- infer unrelated project identity
- produce extraction or drilling recommendations
- bypass CORE data boundaries

## 4. Determinism

All material libraries and coefficients used must be versioned and logged.

## 5. Required Artifacts

- `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`
- `RUN_CONDITIONS.json`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `MATERIAL_STACK.json`
- `IMPEDANCE_REPORT.json`
- `CONDUCTIVITY_FIELD.json`
- `DAMPING_PROFILE.json`
- `ARTIFACT_INDEX.json`

## 6. Safety & Misuse Controls

Outputs must include:
- assumptions and limitations
- warnings where inputs are insufficient

## 7. Publishing Rules

Sealed run required.

## 8. Amendments

Governance review required.
